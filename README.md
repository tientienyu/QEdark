# QEdark

## The `QEdark` code is based on work as published in [arXiv:1509.01598](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01598) by Rouven Essig, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Jeremy Mardon, Adrian Soto, Tomer Volansky, and Tien-Tien Yu

The following repository contains the analysis notebooks for [QEdark](https://github.com/adrian-soto/QEdark_repo), which are needed for calculating dark matter-electron scattering in semiconductor targets. We provide both Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks, which utilize the tabulated form-factors calculated using [QEdark](https://github.com/adrian-soto/QEdark_repo). 

## Repository content
The folders of this repository are:
- *QEdark-python/*: contains an example notebook (QEdark_f2.ipynb) to calculate the rate and cross-section for silicon using the imported crystal form-factor Si_f2.txt. 
- *Mathematica*: contains notebooks to calculate the rate and cross-section for crystal targets (QEdark.nb, QEdark-f2.nb) and for liquid xenon (LDM_Xenon.nb)
